**Objective:** Your weekend lab is to make something using all the aspects of CRUD. It's up to you to come up with an idea, but it must have **a model, views, controllers, and routes** to `create`, `read`, `update` and `delete` at least one resource.

**NOTE** you don't need to add users and authentication. Actually, don't add authentication just to fulfill the CRUD requirement because that would be boring.

In addition, you are **required to use a gem or feature of Rails which hasn't been covered explicitly in class**.
