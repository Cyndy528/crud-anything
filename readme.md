Your weekend lab is to make something using all the aspects of CRUD. It is up to you to come up with an idea but it must have routes to create, read, update and delete something.

**NOTE** you don't need to add users and authentication. Actually, don't add authentication just to fulfill the CRUD requirement because that is boring.

In addition, you are required to use a gem or feature of Rails which hasn't been covered explicitly in class.

Example gems or Rails features.
